## Programming assignments for Data Science for Linguistics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assignment 1

**Topic**: GitHub

### Overview

In this assignment you will practice the basics of working with project
repos using GitHub and the GitHub desktop app. Specifically, you will
fork this repo, clone it to your computer, contribute to it, push
changes from your local repo (your computer) to your upstream branch
(your forked copy on GitHub), and, finally, submit a pull request to
merge your contribution with the master repo (the professor’s copy).

**Assigned**: Week 1  
**Due**: Wednesday, 1/27 before 10pm

### Instructions

1.  If you have not already done so, fork this repo and clone it to your
    computer.
2.  In your local copy create a personal ‘dropbox’
    1.  create an empty folder named “lastname\_firstname” (ex.
        casillas\_joseph). Put it inside `misc > students`.
    2.  create another **README.md** file and place it inside your
        personal folder. Include the following info:
        -   Your name
        -   Your email
        -   Your personal website if you have one
        -   A goal you have for this class
3.  Create another folder. Name it `summaries` and place it inside your
    personal dropbox folder. Next, read [Wickham,
    2015](https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/mererenovation/17_Wickham.PDF).
    Create a file called **wickham\_2015\_summary.md** and write a 4
    sentence summary about the article. Save this file in `summaries`
    inside your personal dropbox (the lastname\_firstname folder you
    just made).
4.  Read [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) Preface - Ch. 2
    (p. ix-41). Do all examples included in the text as you read
    (nothing to turn in).
5.  Read QML Ch. 1 (pp. 1-33). Do the R examples included in the text as
    you read (nothing to turn in).
6.  Commit the changes to your upstream branch, i.e., your copy of the
    repo on github.com. Check your repo on GitHub to make sure it
    worked, and then submit a pull-request. It should include the
    following…
    1.  your dropbox folder (lastname\_firstname)
    2.  a README.md file
    3.  a summaries folder (inside your dropbox)
    4.  your Wickham (2015) summary (wickham\_2015\_summary.md)

### Evaluation

### Tips

This is how the file structure currently looks:

    programming_assignments
           │
           ├── README.md
           └── misc
               └── students
                   ├── README.md
                   └── firstname_lastname
                       ├── README.md
                       └── summaries
                           └── wickham_2015_summary.md

Take a look inside the `lastname_firstname` folder if you need an
example (this is highly recommended). Your personal dropbox should look
exactly the same, but with your information, summaries, etc. In other
words, you will add a folder inside `students` that looks like this (I
am using my name, you will use your name):

    casillas_joseph
            │
            ├── README.md
            └── summaries
                └── wickham_2015_summary.md

Remember to check the [GitHub setup
tutorial](https://ds4ling.github.io/sources/tuts/github_setup/index.html)
if you need help pushing your changes and submitting a pull request.
