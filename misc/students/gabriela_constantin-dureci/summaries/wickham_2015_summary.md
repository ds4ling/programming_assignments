Wickham (2015) uses *abstinence* as a metaphor to discuss some of the ways in which statistics have alienated people from using them. Moreover, the author suggests ways to talk about stats to those who are inexperienced, so that statistics will appeal to them. I highlighted the following sentence that seemed to extend beyond the article: "unmitigated freedom is both overwhelming and potentially dangerous". Ultimately, Wickham speaks to all of us who are on our stats journey and are, perhaps, doubting if it is the right time for it: "we can not be paralyzed by all the potential dangers".
