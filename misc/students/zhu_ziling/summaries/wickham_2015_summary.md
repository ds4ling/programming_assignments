# Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstinence

## Wickham (2015) summary

Abstinence based statistics is problematic because people choose to do statistics by themselves even with some risks, and not enough professional statisticians can go around. Instead, we should teach safe-stats, the grammars of data analysis we develop for which are flexible and constraining. Flexibility is realized through embedding the grammar in a programming language. Learning programming is achievable with long-term small practice.
