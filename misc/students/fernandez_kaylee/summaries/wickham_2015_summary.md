Wickham (2015) argues that the teaching of statistics needs to shift its approach.
According to Wickham, the mainstream approach to teaching statistics focuses on teaching students how to do statistics correctly, and students are often given the impression that doing statistics independently is an unattainable goal. 
Wickham suggests that amateur statistics should be encouraged by teaching students the skills they really need to do statistics. 
For example, Wickham proposes students be taught to program early on and that instructors should first focus on teaching students how to adapt and use codes and, subsequently, how to rearrange code more creatively.
