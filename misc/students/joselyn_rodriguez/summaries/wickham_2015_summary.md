## summary for Wickham (2015)

This was a short article discussing the importance of statistical literacy for students rather than
ignoring statistics altogether or relying wholly on statisticians. In order to do this, Wickham introduces
the idea that students need to be provided with easily approachable fail-safe tools that will
allow them to get started in statistics while still having statistical training wheels of a sort. In 
this way, they'll be able to begin working on statistical analyses in a relatively safer environment.
Having practical programming skills will also begin to prepare the students for more complex analyses
down the road.
