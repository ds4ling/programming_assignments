# Summary of *Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstinence*, (Wickham, 2015)

Wickham states that students should be provided with fun and empowering tools that allow them to practice safe statistics.
Wickham believes that in order to teach safe statistics, it is necessary to develop grammars of data analysis that lay out the minimal independent components that could be used to solve a wide range of problems. 
Grammars need to be flexible, since you should be able to recombine the components to solve a variety of new problems, but they also need to be constraining in order to guide users toward better outcomes. 
Wickham emphasizes that grammars must be embedded into programming languages so that statistics students are taught to program and can gradually start to use and adapt code to show interesting tools, which will prepare them for diving into data analysis.
