# Teaching Safe-Stats, Not Statistical Abstinence

## Wickham (2015) summary

Statistics as a field should take amateur curriculums more seriously as they are quite useful. 
It means that skills for practicing safe-stats should be provided. 
To achieve this purpose, grammars of data analysis embedded in a programming language should be taught.
It is achievable to teach programming from the first statistics course.
