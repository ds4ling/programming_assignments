Hadley Wickham describes how the field of data science should not remain exclusive to professional statisticians, and that we should not encourage others from abstaining from this field. He describes that the most useful grammars necessary to generate powerful computerized graphics are those that have a wide array of applications (flexibility) but that also have some limits as to what they can accomplish (constraints). Coding provides the freedom necessary within the constraints of an existing language; therefore, all statisticians (students, data scientists, or real-life "quants") should learn to code. This gives each involved person the intellectual freedom necessary to explore and to expand their knowledge of statistical inquiries, and stumbling is an integral part of this process.
